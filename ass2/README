Server Sequence:

- accept client socket
- delegate to new client service thread
    - read line as user id
    - look for user
        - for each known user
            - decrypt sent user id with key
            - compare for match with known id
    - if not found
        - send "access-denied"
        - close socket
    - else if found
        - send "access-granted"
        - read line
        - while line is not equal to "finished"
            - check for line as file in dir
            - if not found
                - send file-not-found
                - continue while
            - else if found
                - send file-exists
                - read file into string
                - encrypt string
                - send ciphertext
                - continue while
        - close socket
