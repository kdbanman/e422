Server Sequence:

- accept client socket
- delegate to new client service thread
    - read line as user id
    - look for user
        - for each known user
            - decrypt sent user id with key
            - compare for match with known id
    - if not found
        - send "access-denied"
        - close socket
    - else if found
        - send "access-granted"
        - read line
        - while line is not equal to "finished"
            - check for line as file in dir
            - if not found
                - send file-not-found
                - continue while
            - else if found
                - send file-exists
                - read file into string
                - encrypt string bytes
                - send ciphertext
                - continue while
        - close socket

Client Sequence:

- connect to server socket
- until the server sends "access-granted"
    - prompt user for id and passkey
    - encrypt the id with the passkey
    - send the cipher to the server
- until the user inputs "finished"
    - prompt user for filepath (break loop if "finished")
    - encrypt file path
    - send cipher to server
    - if server responds with file ack
        - report ack
        - receive file
        - save file
    - else if server responds with file nack
        - report nack
- send "finished" to server
- close socket
