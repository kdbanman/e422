InterfaceException, LocalException, and FailureExceptions are all thrown, and
all are visible on terminal output when they occur.  LocalException does *not*
terminate the program, the others do.  FailureException is considered root
level, and is not within a catch block (i.e. it is thrown by main()).

A simulated hardware failure and a failure to properly sort are treated
identically, as both are detected by the adjudicator's acceptance test, and both
result in thrown LocalExceptions.

I took the fail probability generator spec very literally.
    - There are far more variable accesses in the heapsort, so it has a much
      higher overall probability of failure given the same input probability
    - For a relatively high probability of either variant failing, run with
        - Primary failure probability: 0.0003
        - Backup failure probability: 0.01

The IntSorter as an abstract class may seem like overkill, but it seemed like
such a perfect candidate for extensibility :)
